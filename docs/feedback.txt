Compiled Feedback Notes from Prof

7/8/24: 

- Merged in his PR
- It includes a module that creates a csv file with multiple simulated test results.
- My suggestion is to figure out which type of plot you want and integrate that into a dash app. 
- The app would load a simulated file with results for a (large) group of people, maybe all test done in your company so far.  I've given you an example of a upload to dash (did that after the recording was made)  
- You would then upload results for one or more participants (maybe a group that was tested recently in a session) and plot these on top of your visualization of the large group for which I gave you 2 examples.
- I guess another step would be to hook up the actual test, so somebody could do the test and immediatly see where they stand, but that's totally optional.
- Re classes: for none of this would you need to create  you own class as all the data would come from and go to dataframes and csv files

6/30/24:
- CSV outputs contain scores and questions, only need scores
- Update file path for CSV saving to be relative vs. absolute

6/20/24: Version 1 progress report A
- Video of debugging demo, indexing error 
- Was able to solve and get functions to pass, CSV file is generating

6/9/24: Spec Feedback
- I agree, please start with a notebook. I think the visualization for a single user would be pretty simple, so how about you write a routine to randomly generate a HEXACO personality and store that in a csv file. You could then do more interesting summary statistics and plots with that.
- I don't forsee that processing would take very long and even if its a couple of seconds it's fine if the UI just freezes for now.
- I like that you propose to use OOP for this.
- Re GUI let's postpone that until the end of version 1, I have a couple of suggestions.
