# HEXACO Personality Visualization Project

<!-- Update README for user's guide assignment, due 7/29 -->
<!-- Review this for structural finessing: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/ -->

## Description:

This project is based on data from the HEXACO psychological assessment tool (https://hexaco.org/). The HEXACO acronym comes from these six major dimensions of personality measured: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness (versus Anger), Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.

The survey consists of 100 questions, each mapped to one of the six personality dimensions. Respondents rate each question on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Inspiration for this project taken from https://github.com/salastro/hexaco-person/blob/main/README.md
