# HEXACO Personality Visualization Project

## Description:

### This project is based on data from the HEXACO psychological assessment tool. The HEXACO acronym comes from these six major dimensions of personality measured: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness (versus Anger), Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.

### The survey consists of 100 questions, each mapped to one of the six personality dimensions. Respondents rate each question on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

## File Structure:

### configs = Initial directory for any configuration files. Stubbed out a placeholder Plotly file for future use as UI visualization comes together.

### data = Data source files

### docs = Resource and reference documentation files

### templates = Placeholder for directory required by Flask

### main.ipynb = Main Jupyter notebook runnable file
